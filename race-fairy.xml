            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Fairies rarely reach over 1 foot tall, and their wings come in many designs and patterns, ranging from butterfly to beetle. They often look like tiny elves, with pointed ears and ranging skin tones. They carry the normal array of human skin tones as well as light shades of the rest of the spectrum of colors, coming from light shades of red to copper and bronze. They can even carry small attributes of the insect family they hail from, including antennae, fluff, and the wing styles. Their eyes often look like a molten liquid but the pupils can be visible if you can ever get a close enough look. They love vibrantly colored clothes or shiny metal armor, something that speaks about their personality on a level that other pixies and some people can understand.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Fairies are nature's immature answer to elves. They are chaotic even with their laws. They are shy and reclusive and adore playing tricks and pranks, seldom bothering outsiders otherwise unless their curiosity gets the better of them.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>n the world, fairies make their homes in deep forests or hidden grottos beneath the hills of the Moonshae Isles, far beyond the sight of other humanoids. In these places, fairies cast their shimmering lights to color their domains in incandescent hues, gradually shifting from soft red to bright yellow to deep violet and back again. Some say that the realms of the fairies are the places where rainbows begin and end, and those rainbows are fairy roads emanating from the light of the kingdoms they connect, which can be seen by mortals only when the sun shines through the rain. Though fairies prefer to keep out of sight, they can be found almost anywhere in the Feywild. As intrinsically magical as they are whimsical, fairies enhance the world around them with their presence.</p>
            <h4>DRYAD NAMES</h4>
            <p>Fairies will often take on the names of humans or elves, and sometimes those of the plants and trees that they find their homes in.</p>

            <h4>FAIRY TRAITS</h4>
            <p>They are shy and reclusive flying fey creature that adores playing tricks and pranks on others.</p>
